## 2026-09-14 — MLB pipeline retired on atlas; project pivots to NFL on old-will-macbook

Will's decision (manager session at C:\Code, 2026-09-14): stop the MLB fantasy work on
atlas now rather than waiting for the 2026-09-30 timer, and do not move it anywhere. The
next season of this project is an NFL fantasy database that runs on old-will-macbook
(Tailscale 100.126.114.42) as pure cron, no AI tokens: Yahoo expected points pulled the
morning of each game, live NFL stats plus actual fantasy points added that night, and a
read path Edwin can query instead of hitting live APIs. The local folder is to be renamed
to match the GitHub repo name.

What was done on atlas, as root, 2026-09-15 03:16 UTC: ran the pre-written
`/usr/local/sbin/fantasy-shutdown.sh`. Verified afterwards: `systemctl list-timers` shows
no fantasy timers; ingest/views/anomaly/health/publish/shutdown all `disabled`; the
`~edwincode/fantasy-bot` symlink is gone (retires the publish/advisor/triage loops in
Edwin's bot.py); no fantasy processes running; Discord notice posted. Nothing deleted:
the checkout, `fantasy.db` and views are still in `/home/edwincode/edwin-repos/fantasy-bot`.
Reversal: `sudo /usr/local/sbin/fantasy-restore.sh` on atlas.

## 2026-08-30 — write path hardened, and the iMac-era docs finally rewritten

Closing out the same night's work.

**Every write now proves itself.** `set_lineup` already had the read-back added
for the triage; `add_drop` and `propose_trade` had their own versions of the
same wrong assumption. All three fixed in `276ca64`:

| Function | What it returns now |
|---|---|
| `set_lineup` | `applied`, `stuck`, `verified` from a roster read-back |
| `add_drop` (FREEAGENT) | `verified`, and `ok=False` if the roster did not change |
| `add_drop` (WAIVER) | `pending=True` — deliberately unconfirmable, a claim sits until waivers process |
| `propose_trade` | `pending=True`, and says nothing changes until the other manager accepts |

Callers should believe those fields, never bare `ok`. The triage now reads
`stuck` off the result instead of making its own second round-trip. The
read-back branches have **not** run against live ESPN: every game was final
by the time they were written, so there was no legal move to test them with.
First real move of the next game day exercises them.

**Docs rewritten.** `MIGRATION_2026-07-21.md` §5 listed seven files still
describing the iMac world as current, six weeks after it stopped being true.
Rewritten under that section's own rule, which is that the iMac is historical
and must not be deleted from the record: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
`OPERATING_RUNBOOK.md`, `CHAT_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `INTEGRATION.md` and
`fantasy_baseball_instructions.md` now describe atlas-cloud, systemd timers,
Edwin's in-process loops and Discord alerting, with the iMac kept as a dated
historical section in each. The only surviving `claudeserver` / `crontab`
strings are the ones deliberately labelled historical or saying "there is no
crontab".

**The correction that mattered most:** every one of those docs implied the
schedule was one thing you could list. It is two. Four systemd timers, and
three loops inside `edwin.service` that `systemctl list-timers` will never
show. That gap is precisely why the roster triage went unnoticed, and every
rewritten doc now says so explicitly.

**Still open, deliberately not touched tonight:**
- The 3:00 AM `espn_nightly_moves.py` + `league_snapshot.py` pair and the
  Sunday `espn_weekly_report.py` email have no systemd equivalent on
  atlas-cloud. Port or retire, Will's call.
- The iMac's own crontab state is UNVERIFIED from this session. Decommission
  is a separate, destructive job.
- Where Edwin's gate line should sit (currently: roster moves free, trades and
  money wait for Will) has not been revisited.

## 2026-08-30 — the triage was announcing lineup moves ESPN had already locked

Found while checking whether the 30-minute triage was running at all. It was.
The moves were not.

**The defect.** ESPN freezes a player's roster slot the moment his game starts.
A slot change involving him is answered `HTTP 200` and then silently ignored.
`fantasy_exec._post_transaction` treats 200 as success, so `set_lineup` returned
`ok=True`, and `roster_triage` posted "the lineup has changed" to Discord. The
next cycle recomputed the identical swap, because nothing had moved, and posted
it again. Observed all evening on 2026-08-30: Cavalli in, Detmers out, both
games Final, every 30 minutes.

**The second cause underneath it.** `build_team_matchups()` read
`fetch_schedule()`, which caches once per calendar day. The copy written by the
4am job says every game is `Preview`, so even a lock-aware check would have seen
an empty schedule of started games. `bot.py` already knew this and passed
`force_refresh=True` for its own window check; the triage did not.

**Fixed in `01f2893`.**
- `build_team_matchups(date_str=None, force_refresh=False)` now also reports
  `started` per team, from `abstractGameState != "Preview"`. A postponed game
  reads as Final but never locks anyone, so it is excluded and stays movable.
- `roster_triage` calls it with `force_refresh=True` every cycle.
- Locked players are pinned where they sit. An active one keeps his slot and
  spends pitcher capacity (`open_capacity = PITCHER_CAPACITY - len(locked_active)`);
  a benched one is not a candidate at all. The pitcher rebuild, which is a full
  daily rebuild by design, now happens around them instead of through them.
- After a real submit the roster is read back and only the moves that actually
  landed are reported. If none landed, the run stays silent and logs the fact
  rather than posting a change that did not happen. Same lesson as `6a7aa6d`,
  which stopped the morning brief asserting an add/drop before ESPN confirmed it.

**Verified on the live roster the same night**, with all 28 teams' games started:
the triage proposes nothing. Re-run against the identical roster with `started`
forced to `False`, the two phantom moves reappear. The fix is scoped to the
lock, it does not mute the pass.

**Still true and not fixed here:** a 200 from ESPN is not proof of anything.
The read-back is the only reliable confirmation, and any future write path
(`add_drop`, `propose_trade`) should get the same treatment before it is trusted.

## 2026-08-30 — `roster_triage.py` is driven by Edwin, not by a timer

Recorded here because this repo's docs do not say who runs this script, and that
gap cost a day of lineup coverage.

`roster_triage.py` is **not** on a systemd timer and never was. It is launched by
`fantasy_triage_loop()` in Edwin's `bot.py` (repo `willrphillips/edwin`), every 30
minutes, from 30 minutes before the day's first pitch until the last game goes
final. `systemctl list-timers 'fantasy-*'` will never show it, so do not conclude
from that list that the check does not exist. The five things that ARE timers are
ingest 3:30, views 4:30, anomaly 4:45, health 6:00 and the 2026-10-01 shutdown;
brief and publish are also Edwin-driven, in-process.

On 2026-08-30 the loop was found dead, having logged nothing either way, and
Edwin's own brief never mentioned the job at all. Fixed on the Edwin side in
`743265d`: every run logs, each tick is wrapped so one exception cannot end the
task, and the triage now has an on/off switch (`/triage status|on|off|now`, state
in `~/codex/edwin/state/fantasy-triage-enabled.txt`, missing file means on). Full
write-up in that repo's `SCOPE_OF_WORK.md` under the same date.

`FANTASY_TRIAGE_DRY_RUN=1 python3 roster_triage.py` remains the safe way to ask
what the triage would do right now; it submits nothing and posts nothing.

## 2026-07-21 — baseball Discord alerting live; write path partially validated

Deployed to the iMac (`~/fantasy-bot`, reachable via Tailscale SSH as
`claudeserver@100.79.105.6` — **not a git repo**, deploy is `scp` file-by-file
until a real deploy mechanism is decided). Session covered:

- **Fixed the live stale-db bug.** `db_publish.py`'s retry logic (from
  `ad0e16b`, previously undeployed) fixed a real failure: a 502 on the 32 MB
  Contents-API PUT had left GitHub's `fantasy.db` a day stale while views kept
  publishing. Re-pushed; confirmed the Pages copy is byte-identical to local
  (32,174,080 bytes).
- **Deployed the write-tooling layer for the first time.** `fantasy_exec.py`
  (new portable module — see `INTEGRATION.md`), `set_lineup.py`,
  `waiver_move.py`, `apply_pending.py` were on GitHub but had never reached
  the iMac. Now deployed, syntax-checked on the box's Python 3.9.6.
- **Found and fixed a real bug via live testing.** Dry-running the *current*
  lineup back through `set_lineup()`/`fantasy_exec.set_lineup()` produced 7
  phantom moves (`Soto OF->OF`, `Yamamoto P->P`, ...). Cause: `espn_api`
  reports `lineupSlot` as a label, not a numeric ID, so every P collapses to
  slot 11 and every OF to slot 5 on read — the matcher was free to shuffle
  between them. Fixed in `fantasy_exec.py` (pin-then-match, plus a
  from-label==to-label filter); `set_lineup.py` on the iMac has the same
  underlying issue and was **left as-is** (see `INTEGRATION.md` §6 — two
  copies of the eligibility solver now exist; collapse onto `fantasy_exec`
  once it's fully proven).
- **Write path status: read verified, POST still unverified.** `whoami()`,
  `get_roster()`, and a `set_lineup(..., dry_run=True)` round-trip all ran
  live and correctly. **No transaction has ever been submitted** — `add_drop`
  and a real (non-empty) lineup change remain untested against live ESPN.
  Per standing rule, first `--apply` must happen with Will present.
- **Baseball Discord alerting is live**, replacing email. Added
  `discord_webhooks.alerts` to `config.json`, deployed the current
  `notify.py` (Discord-first, no email fallback — this is why deploying it
  *before* the webhook existed would have made alerts silently log-only), and
  confirmed with a real posted test message. `db_publish` / `mlb_ingest` /
  `health_check` throttle state preserved; only the manual test key was
  cleared.
- **Sunday Funday confirmed ESPN Fantasy Football** (`league_id
  1068408855`), not baseball — found via Gmail archaeology, `team_id` still
  unknown. **Do not wire this league's ids into `fantasy_exec.py` as-is**:
  `LeagueCtx.base_url` is hardcoded to the `flb` (baseball) API segment; a
  `sport` field must be added to the per-league config first or its
  transactions will target the wrong sport's endpoint. Cast Final Fantasy has
  no trace anywhere yet — fully unresourced. Both leagues **parked** per
  Will's explicit instruction; baseball only for now.
- **No deploy mechanism exists yet.** `~/fantasy-bot` has no `.git`; a push to
  GitHub `main` never reaches the iMac. Manual `scp` is the only path today.
  Decision on `deploy.sh` vs. converting to a real git checkout is **open,
  deliberately unmade** this session.

## 2026-07-20 — auto-lineup + waiver-scan design locked (NOT YET BUILT)

Will asked for two things: (1) a function that adjusts the roster
automatically each day based on who is playing and matchup projections,
and (2) Edwin to text him any waiver-wire moves he should make. Design
and the load-bearing choices were locked this session; **no code was
written — Will was out of usage and asked to record everything and
close.** Resume from here.

- **Decision 1 — lineup apply: auto, after one validation run.** The
  daily lineup computes and **auto-applies each morning on the iMac**
  (hands-off), EXCEPT the very first run is dry-run only so Will eyeballs
  the moves once — because the ESPN write path is still UNVALIDATED (see
  the open item above / 2026-06-10 entry). After one clean dry run, flip
  to auto. Rationale: a daily lineup is reversible next morning, so
  auto-apply is low-risk *once the write path is proven*. Lineup is the
  ONLY piece that auto-applies.
- **Decision 2 — start/sit logic: ESPN gates, fantasy.db ranks.** Use
  ESPN's per-day projection to decide **who is playing today** (bench any
  eligible player projected ~0 — off day / not playing), then **rank the
  players who are playing by fantasy.db L14 form** (`window_stats`)
  weighted for Strategy C (HR/RBI up, protect W/ERA/WHIP/K, HLD scores,
  punt SV/SB). Seat the top eligible into slots via the existing
  eligibility-safe `set_lineup.compute_moves()` — never bypass it.
  UNVERIFIED data question for the build: `espn_utils.parse_roster`
  currently reads the *season* projected breakdown from `stats[0]`
  (`projected_breakdown`). Confirm on the iMac that ESPN exposes a
  *per-scoring-period (daily)* projection — likely a different `stats`
  key — before trusting the "who's playing today" gate. If no reliable
  daily projection exists, fall back to ESPN's lineup-lock / start status
  as the "is he playing" signal.
- **Decision 3 — waiver delivery: Edwin relay on atlas-cloud. DEFERRED.**
  Waivers stay **propose-only / gated** (matches the handbook's
  always-gated principle and Will's own "moves I *should make*" framing —
  they are NOT auto-executed). Delivery path: the scan writes a
  recommendation file into the Dropbox-synced workspace; **Edwin**
  (Discord assistant on atlas-cloud, `edwin.service`) polls it and DMs
  Will in his own voice. **Queued for later — not this session.** For a
  first cut, the existing `espn_utils.send_email()` can carry the
  recommendations until the Edwin hook is wired.
- **Planned files (not yet written).** `auto_lineup.py` — pulls the
  roster, applies Decision 2 to pick starters, calls `compute_moves()`,
  applies via `apply_lineup_moves()` (dry-run on the first run).
  `waiver_scan.py` — ranks add/drops from `fantasy_lib` (`hot_bats` /
  `cold_bats` / `regression_watch`, FA-only) under Strategy C, writes the
  recommendation for Edwin. Both run from a new iMac cron line each
  morning **before the lineup lock**, after the nightly ingest/publish
  chain.
- **Approved starter list is the approved output.** An approved lineup
  remains a list of desired starters fed to `compute_moves()`;
  `auto_lineup.py` just generates that list instead of hand-authoring
  `starters.json`. The eligibility-safe planner and the gated
  `apply_pending.py` queue are unchanged and still authoritative.

## 2026-06-10 — ESPN write tooling added (NEEDS LIVE VALIDATION)

Built an opt-in roster-automation layer so an approved proposal can be
executed on the ESPN team. **Status: code merged to `main`, but NOT yet
validated against live ESPN.** This is the one open item on the project.

- **What was added.** `espn_utils.apply_lineup_moves()` (atomic multi-slot
  `LINEUP` transaction) and `espn_utils.waiver_move()` (add/drop in one
  transaction); `set_lineup.py` (seats approved starters into *eligible*
  slots via bipartite matching, aborts rather than ever making an illegal
  move; `compute_moves()` is the reusable planner); `waiver_move.py` (CLI
  add/drop); `apply_pending.py` (iMac cron executor — reads
  `pending_moves.json`, runs each approved entry once by `id`, logs to
  `applied_log.jsonl`, emails a confirmation; `--pull` git-pulls first so
  an approval committed to the repo flows through hands-off).
- **Why unvalidated.** This was built from Claude Code on the web (Regime
  B), which cannot reach `fantasy.espn.com` — the transaction POST payloads
  are written to ESPN's documented private-API shape but were never
  executed. The `move_player()` LINEUP payload is the proven reference;
  the add/drop (`FREEAGENT`/`WAIVER`) payload is the higher-risk unknown.
- **TO COMPLETE (run on the iMac, Regime A):**
  1. `python3 set_lineup.py --starters starters.json` (dry run) → confirm
     the printed moves match intent.
  2. `python3 set_lineup.py --starters starters.json --apply` → confirm it
     took in the ESPN app. If HTTP error, capture `resp.text` and fix the
     payload in `espn_utils.apply_lineup_moves`.
  3. Repeat the dry-run → apply cycle for `waiver_move.py` (the add/drop
     shape is the most likely to need a tweak).
  4. Only after both succeed: install the `apply_pending.py --pull` cron
     (every few minutes) and decide the approval-delivery channel
     (commit `pending_moves.json` to this repo; the iMac pulls it).
- **Locked decision (write path).** Lineup moves must stay
  eligibility-safe: never POST a player to a slot they aren't eligible for.
  `set_lineup.compute_moves` enforces this via matching and returns an
  error instead of guessing. Don't bypass it.

## 2026-06-05 — matchups + standings defects fixed (the two that "stood")

The two data-correctness defects flagged on 2026-06-04 are now fixed in
`mlb_ingest.py` `fetch_fantasy_state`, verified against live ESPN.

- **`matchups` table populated.** Root cause: the box-score parser read
  a nonexistent `score` key, so every `home_value`/`away_value` landed
  NULL and every `leader` defaulted to `'tied'`. espn_api exposes
  `home_stats`/`away_stats` as `{CAT: {"value": float, "result":
  "WIN"|"LOSS"|"TIE"|None}}`. Fix: read `value`; derive `leader` from
  the home team's `result` (this correctly handles lower-is-better cats
  like ERA/WHIP — a raw value compare would invert them); and **skip the
  6 component stats** (AB, H, OUTS, ER, P_H, P_BB) which carry
  `result=None` and are not scored categories. 11 scored cats × 5
  matchups = 55 rows/day. Verified: values present, leaders correct.
- **`standings.rank` matches ESPN.** rank is now pinned to ESPN's
  authoritative `team.standing` (not the loop index), and `pct` counts
  ties as half a win `(wins + 0.5*ties)/gp` — matching ESPN's H2H
  category win%. Verified: CP rank 6, pct .520 (was .465 ignoring ties).
- **One-time scrub.** The morning's buggy nightly had already written 30
  stale NULL component-cat rows for 2026-06-05; deleted them
  (`DELETE FROM matchups WHERE date_pulled=MAX AND home_value IS NULL`)
  and republished. Future nightlies are clean by construction.
- **Diagnostic-first.** Wrote a throwaway `_diag_espn.py` to print the
  real espn_api `box_scores`/standings shapes before editing — fixed
  against ground truth, not a guess. Removed after.
- **Locked decision:** matchup `leader` derives from ESPN's `result`
  field, not a value comparison. Don't revert to value-compare; it
  silently inverts ratio categories.

## 2026-06-04 — finalize: anomaly digest, repo cleanup, heartbeat confirmed

Ingest/publish confirmed live: nightly pull 21 (2026-06-04, mode
nightly, 0 errors, 14.4 min), db + views published to GitHub Pages at
09:01 GMT, public URLs return 200. NOTE — "0 errors" means the run
finalized; it does not mean every derived table is correct.
`OPERATING_RUNBOOK.md` (added in parallel work) records two real
data-correctness defects that, as of this entry, still stood: the
`matchups` table was empty (all `leader='tied'`, values NULL) and
`standings.rank` did not match ESPN's tiebreakers. **Both were fixed the
next day — see the 2026-06-05 entry above.** Flagged here so the "live"
claim wasn't read as "everything correct." The stat / window / waiver /
anomaly paths were already sound. Three finishing items completed.

- **Anomaly digest added (`anomaly.py`).** Builds an 8th view,
  `anomaly_digest.md` — the standout single-game hitting and pitching
  lines from the most recent game day, each shown against the player's
  season-to-date baseline. Implemented as a deterministic Python script
  (chosen over a Claude-Code agent: consistent with the all-Python
  pipeline, no per-run LLM cost, version-controlled, deployable to the
  iMac). Daily line = latest snapshot minus the prior snapshot.
  **Load-bearing: INNER JOIN to the prior snapshot, never
  COALESCE-to-zero** — a LEFT JOIN would report a player's whole season
  as one game whenever the prior-day row is missing. Honesty: baselines
  are season-to-date only (no career data in this db; never claims
  "career best"). Writes into `public/views/`, so `db_publish.py`'s
  `*.md` glob and `health_check.py`'s freshness glob both pick it up
  with no change. New cron line at 4:45 (after views, before publish).
  Verified live against the published 2026-06-03 db: sensible output,
  correct slash baselines. Fixed a latent cross-platform bug — writes
  now force `encoding="utf-8"` (the digest uses em dash / ≤; the iMac is
  UTF-8 but `write_text` defaults to the platform codec).
- **Repo cleanup.** Removed two superseded tracked docs:
  `fantasy baseball instructions.txt` and
  `fantasy_baseball_project_context.md`. The canonical
  `fantasy_baseball_instructions.md` states verbatim that it supersedes
  the `.txt`; the `project_context.md` was the same older content.
  Kept `fantasy_baseball_instructions.md` (canonical chat context) and
  `CHAT_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (the distinct claude.ai paste). Also
  committed the previously-untracked `SUGGESTED_AGENTS.md`. `files.zip`
  stays gitignored (build artifact). Parallel work's
  `OPERATING_RUNBOOK.md` referenced the deleted `.txt` by name in three
  places; repointed all three to the canonical
  `fantasy_baseball_instructions.md` (which preserves the `.txt`'s rules
  verbatim) so no reference dangles.
- **Heartbeat decision confirmed, not changed.** Reviewed the
  failure-only alerting design and kept it. Silence = green is
  acceptable because `health_check.py` is the independent watchdog and
  is the one thing that catches "cron never fired at all." No daily or
  weekly heartbeat added — see the locked decision below, which stands.

## 2026-05-21 — universe expansion, statcast fix

- **Statcast BOM bug fixed.** Savant's CSV ships a UTF-8 BOM
  (`﻿`) that broke `csv.DictReader`'s detection of the leading
  quoted field (`"last_name, first_name"`). Header columns shifted by
  one, `player_id` ended up holding the year ("2026") for every row,
  and the UNIQUE constraint collapsed all 643 daily inserts into one
  row per side. `fetch_savant_csv` now strips the BOM before parsing.
  Verified live: 266 unique batter ids in post-fix output, statcast
  table now grows by 643 rows/day. The 6 garbage rows
  (`mlb_id=2026`) were deleted.
- **Universe expanded to all active MLB players.** New helpers in
  `mlb_ingest.py`: `fetch_mlb_player_records()` (one API call returns
  every season-roster player) and `populate_mlb_universe(cur, today,
  records, counts)` (upserts every MLB player into `players` and
  refreshes `last_tracked`). `tracked_player_ids` unions the universe
  with rosters + fa_pool. Smoke-tested on 5 players; full bulk
  backfill launched via nohup (PID 31804, ETA ~8 hours).
- **Cron rescheduled.** Ingest at ~1110 players will run ~25-30 min,
  so the chain was bumped: 3:30 ingest, 4:30 views, 5:00 publish,
  6:00 health_check. Existing 3:00 nightly_moves+snapshot and Sun
  7PM weekly email jobs unchanged.

## 2026-05-19 — initial deploy + three defect fixes

- **Three latent defects in the chat-built code identified and fixed
  in production:**
  1. `cfg["league_id"]` KeyError — `config.json` never had the key.
     Added the field to config and a `LEAGUE_ID_FALLBACK` constant in
     `mlb_ingest.py`. `load_league()` now degrades gracefully on any
     missing key.
  2. ESPN `playerId` is not the MLBAM id. New `id_map` crosswalk
     table + resolver using the MLB season-roster index, name-
     normalized, team-disambiguated. **Policy: ambiguous-or-no-match
     is left UNRESOLVED (mlb_id NULL) and logged WARNING; never
     silently mis-mapped.**
  3. Date skew between fantasy-state tables (run date) and stat
     tables (snapshot date) made every roster/FA report empty.
     Added per-table `latest_*_date()` helpers in `fantasy_lib` and
     decoupled the joins. `trade_scout` rebuilt to anchor rosters at
     `latest_roster_date()` and stats at `latest_date()`.
- **Initial backfill complete.** 393 players × ~54 days → 10,945
  hitting + 8,699 pitching rows, errors 0, duration 2h54m
  (README's "30-90 min" estimate was wrong).
- **Failure-alert layer.** `notify.py` (per-script throttled email,
  ASCII-only because `send_email` chokes on non-ASCII subjects).
  Crash + degradation alerts wired into `mlb_ingest.py`, `views.py`,
  and `db_publish.py`. Self-tested by the `league_id` KeyError
  before that defect was fixed — the alerter sent a real email.
- **`health_check.py` watchdog.** Reads only. Checks DB freshness,
  pull_log errors, Captain Phillips roster coverage (the "ace
  silently missing" guard), views freshness < 26h, and the public
  GitHub Pages URL HTTP 200. Verified green on first run.
- **Cron installed** (3:30 / 3:55 / 4:00 / 5:00) preserving the
  existing jobs. Updated 2026-05-21 to the new times.
- **GitHub Pages URL verified live.** db + views publish nightly and
  the public URL returns 200.

## Locked decisions

These are the load-bearing architectural choices for this pipeline.
Any reversal must be logged here with a date and a reason.

- **Failure-only alerting.** No daily heartbeats. One throttled email
  per script per day via `~/fantasy-bot/.alert_state`. The state file
  is updated only on successful send, so a transient SMTP failure
  doesn't burn the daily slot. Health check is the independent
  watchdog; in-script alerts cover their own scripts only.
- **Unresolved beats mis-mapped.** When the ESPN→MLB resolver can't
  uniquely identify a player (ambiguous duplicate name with no team
  disambiguation), it leaves `mlb_id` NULL and logs a WARNING rather
  than guessing. The watchdog roster-coverage check then surfaces
  the gap explicitly. The user's stated priority ("an ace getting
  silently missed") drove this.
- **Per-table date cadence in fantasy_lib.** Fantasy-state queries
  use their own `latest_*_date()`; stat windows stay anchored on
  `hitting_stats.latest_date()`. The two feeds are not assumed to
  share a date.
- **All-MLB universe.** Tracked set is every active MLB player from
  the season-roster index, unioned with ESPN rosters + FA pool.
  Pipeline serves more than fantasy needs; Claude Chat / Code can
  query any current MLB player.
- **Snapshots, not game-by-game.** `hitting_stats` and
  `pitching_stats` store season-to-date totals per (player, date).
  Windows are computed by subtraction. Statcast is current-snapshot
  only; history builds forward from 2026-05-21.

## Layout

- `~/fantasy-bot/` on the iMac is the runtime home. Cron jobs run
  from there. `config.json` is gitignored — never commit.
- This repo holds source code only. Data files (`fantasy.db`, views)
  publish to `willrphillips/fantasy-snapshots` via `db_publish.py`.
- Public URLs:
  - `https://willrphillips.github.io/fantasy-snapshots/data/fantasy.db`
  - `https://willrphillips.github.io/fantasy-snapshots/views/*.md`
